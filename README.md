# About

Addon that adds support for Portal 2 maps for Garry's Mod. 

Due to the scope of Garry's Mod it is not possible to add support for Vscripts and so on, so support for maps on the engine level is not possible.

## The main purpose of the addon
The minimum to make Portal 2 maps and mods work in GMod.

## Features

* Implemented Vscript be-like system (isolated Lua environments per entity)
* Rewritten Squirrel scripts on Lua [WIP]
* Recreated/ported entities (buttons, doors, NPCs and more) [WIP]
* No edited maps, just mount Portal 2, install addon and play
* For additional features (such as fixed shaders) use external dll (WIP, later)
* Recompiled models to fix compatibility with Garry's Mod
